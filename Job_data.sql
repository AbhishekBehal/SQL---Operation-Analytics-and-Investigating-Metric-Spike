/* Jobs Reviewed Over Time:
Objective: Calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.
Your Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the number of jobs reviewed per hour for each day in November 2020.
Throughput Analysis:
Objective: Calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput (number of events per second).
Your Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the 7-day rolling average of throughput. Additionally, explain whether you prefer using the daily metric or the 7-day rolling average for throughput, and why.
Language Share Analysis:
Objective: Calculate the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days.
Your Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the percentage share of each language over the last 30 days.
Duplicate Rows Detection:
Objective: Identify duplicate rows in the data.
Your Task: Write an SQL query to display duplicate rows from the job_data table.

Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike
You will be working with three tables:

users: Contains one row per user, with descriptive information about that userâ€™s account.
events: Contains one row per event, where an event is an action that a user has taken (e.g., login, messaging, search).
email_events: Contains events specific to the sending of emails.
Tasks:

Weekly User Engagement:
Objective: Measure the activeness of users on a weekly basis.
Your Task: Write an SQL query to calculate the weekly user engagement.
